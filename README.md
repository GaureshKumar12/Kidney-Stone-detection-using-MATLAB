# Kidney Stone Detection in Ultrasonic Images

Overview
This MATLAB project detects kidney stones in ultrasonic images using image processing techniques like thresholding, noise removal, and dimension analysis.

Features
- Converts images to grayscale and removes noise.
- Applies thresholding to extract high-intensity regions.
- Identifies and measures detected stones.

Usage
1. Run the script in MATLAB.
2. Select an ultrasonic image.
3. View processing steps and detection results.

Example Output
```
Stone 1: Width = 22.5 mm, Height = 15.0 mm
Stone is Detected
```
Future Improvements
- Enhance accuracy with machine learning.
- Improve segmentation techniques.
- Add a GUI for easy use.
